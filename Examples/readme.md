Example of codes for future steps

Project-Apo:
- First attempt to understand the BoW approach and the TDif for the SVM and Naive Bayes models on the Davidson dataset.

Project-Apo-v2:
- 6 Models were tests with BoW/TDif together and only BoW: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Decision Tree, GBS, SVM
- Next step: GridSearch for unigram, bigram, trigram and alpha
